# Waveshare 24155 1.28 inch LCD display

This project ia a port on STM32F072 microcontroller of the Waveshare 1.28 inch LCD display demo code. The original code is written for the STM32F103 microcontroller.  
The original code is available at <https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.28inch_LCD_Module>  
This port is based on the original code and the STM32CubeF0 HAL library and is using the STM32CubeIDE.

## Hardware

The Waveshare 1.28 inch LCD display is a 240x240 pixel display with a ST7789V driver. The display is connected to the STM32F072 microcontroller using the SPI interface. The display is powered by 3.3V and the SPI interface is also 3.3V. The display is connected to the following pins of the STM32F072 microcontroller:
